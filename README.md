Classic pub game found in drinking establishments.

Latest:
In src/ is the most recent cpp file.
Change branch to have separated files. The game no longer resides in one long file.

#Building
I use Cxxdroid on Android which uses CMake and SDL installs so Cxxdroid does a great job at running this program on the go.

#Info
There have been many attempts at keeping this game going and repository alive, so the current media choices do not fit as nicely as I have had before. More place holder stuff.
